# Health Recommendation System
## Disease Prediction and Medical Recommendation System

---

## Project Overview

A machine learning-based web application that:
- Predicts diseases based on user-input symptoms
- Provides personalized medical recommendations
- Offers medication, diet, and workout suggestions
- Features an intuitive and user-friendly interface

---

## Problem Statement

- Traditional diagnosis is time-consuming and may lead to delays in treatment
- Patients need quick preliminary assessments before consulting specialists
- Medical recommendations should be personalized based on diagnosed conditions
- Need for accessible healthcare information for common conditions

---

## Solution Approach

Our Health Recommendation System addresses these challenges by:
- Using machine learning to predict diseases from symptoms
- Providing instant preliminary diagnoses
- Offering personalized medical recommendations
- Creating an accessible and user-friendly interface

## Technical Architecture

![System Architecture](https://i.imgur.com/placeholder.png)

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (Random Forest)
- **Data Storage**: CSV files for medical data

---

## Dataset

Comprehensive medical dataset from Kaggle containing:
- 132 unique symptoms
- 41 different diseases
- Medication recommendations
- Dietary guidelines
- Exercise recommendations
- Precautionary measures

---

## Machine Learning Model

- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Features**: 132 symptom indicators (binary)
- **Target**: 41 disease categories
- **Training Data**: 4,920 symptom-disease combinations
- **Model Persistence**: Pickle format for deployment

---

## Key Features

1. **Symptom-Based Disease Prediction**
   - Enter multiple symptoms via text or voice input
   - Spell-correction for symptom matching
   - Accurate disease prediction

2. **Comprehensive Recommendations**
   - Medical descriptions
   - Medication suggestions
   - Dietary guidelines
   - Exercise recommendations
   - Precautionary measures

---

## User Interface

Modern, responsive interface with:
- Clean, intuitive design
- Voice input capability
- Responsive layout for all devices
- Clear presentation of medical information
- Accessible health recommendations

---

## Technical Implementation

### Backend (Flask)
```python
@app.route('/predict', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def home():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        symptoms = request.form.get('symptoms')
        # Process symptoms and predict disease
        predicted_disease = predicted_value(corrected_symptoms)
        # Get recommendations
        dis_des, precautions, medications, rec_diet, workout = information(predicted_disease)
        # Return results
```

---

## Technical Implementation (cont.)

### Machine Learning Model
```python
# Random Forest model training
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Model evaluation
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy*100:.2f}%")

# Save model
pickle.dump(model, open('model/RandomForest.pkl', 'wb'))
```

---

## Demo Workflow

1. User enters symptoms (e.g., "fever, headache, fatigue")
2. System processes and corrects symptom spelling
3. Machine learning model predicts the most likely disease
4. System retrieves personalized recommendations
5. User receives comprehensive health information
